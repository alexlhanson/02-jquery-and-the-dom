# Project Name
jQuery and the DOM
**Author**: Sharon and Alex
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are building a modularized blog with mobile first design and SMACSS approach standardization for CSS. We added jQuery to make the code more efficient and potentionally modularized.  
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
They need to scaffold and HTML structure for the page which includes a template for each article. They need to add css in a SMACSS approach and design it with a mobile first design.  They need to add js files with a jquery library and to utilize jQuery to make the code more efficient. They will render each article as it is submitted and if there is a grouping of articles they will sort them by date. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. --> We used the jQuery library for javascript, HTML, and CSS. We tried to adhear to SMACSS principals and mobile first design.
